For displaying the reports as part of the CI process. we can integrate the cucumber into the Jenkins pipeline

1)In the first step, we create a Jenkins file in the project and define the stages and step of the pipeline.

2)After checking the code into GitHub.

3)In a further step in Jenkins, we add the cucumber reports plugin.
The data integration from the Jenkins file to the cucumber reports is carried out.
While running the Jenkins pipeline, the test reports are displayed and help determine what type of failures and scenarios are executed.
